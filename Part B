Log files can be stored using AWS S3. Since it is a rare occasion that logs up to 3 months old is required, the team can consider using S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA). This allows the team to access the data that are up to 3 months old rapidly when needed. They can configure a S3 lifecycle policy to move the data from Standard -IA (After 3 months) to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep archive. This should assist to store the rarely accessed data for at least 7 years and at a low cost.
